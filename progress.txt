## 2026-01-09: Time Machine Entry Implementation

### Completed
- Added "Time Machine" menu item to File Menu (sidebar-file-menu.tsx)
- Created Time Machine toolbar component (time-machine-toolbar.tsx)
- Created Time Machine bottom bar with slider and navigation buttons (time-machine-bottom-bar.tsx)
- Created time-machine.ts library with edit history functions
- Updated doc.$id.index.tsx route to handle ?timemachine=true&edit={n} search params
- Editor switches to read-only mode when in Time Machine
- URL updates when navigating through Time Machine

### Files Created
- src/components/time-machine-toolbar.tsx
- src/components/time-machine-bottom-bar.tsx
- src/lib/time-machine.ts

### Files Modified
- src/routes/doc.$id.index.tsx (added validateSearch, Time Machine UI conditional rendering)
- src/components/sidebar-file-menu.tsx (added Time Machine menu item)
- prd.json (marked first entry test as passing)

### Notes for Next Person
- The edit history is extracted from Jazz's raw cojson API using core.knownState() and getValidSortedTransactions()
- Each unique timestamp creates a snapshot using raw.atTime(timestamp).toString()
- The slider debounces at 150ms as per PRD requirements
- Keyboard shortcuts ([ and ]) for navigation are NOT yet implemented
- The "Create Copy" and "Restore This Version" actions are in the dropdown but disabled
- Space routes also need Time Machine support (spaces.$spaceId.doc.$id.index.tsx)
- Exit via browser back button is not yet tested/verified

### PRD Status
- "User can enter Time Machine from File Menu" - PASSES
- "Time Machine starts at latest edit" - PASSES

## 2026-01-09: Time Machine - Start at Latest Edit Fix

### Completed
- Added useEffect to redirect URL when entering Time Machine without edit parameter
- URL now automatically updates to include ?timemachine=true&edit={latestEditIndex} on entry
- This ensures URL always reflects the current state (slider at latest edit = N-1 in URL)

### Files Modified
- src/routes/doc.$id.index.tsx (added useEffect to redirect with edit param on Time Machine entry)
- prd.json (marked "Time Machine starts at latest edit" as passing)

### Technical Details
- When user clicks "Time Machine" in File Menu, URL is ?timemachine=true (no edit param)
- A useEffect detects this state (timeMachineMode=true, timeMachineEdit=undefined, totalEdits>0)
- It performs a `replace: true` navigation to add the edit param (totalEdits - 1)
- This ensures URL is shareable and accurately reflects the slider position
