# Progress Log

## 2026-01-10: Slideshow Text Wrapping

**Feature:** slideshow-scaling (3 user stories)

**Changes:**
- Fixed text wrapping: content now wraps at container width instead of scaling to tiny size
- Added `max-w-full` and `overflow-wrap: break-word` to slide blocks for proper text wrapping
- Changed measurement to use width constraint so text wraps before scaling kicks in
- Scaling now only reduces size when wrapped content height exceeds viewport
- Fixed lint errors: refactored `useThemeStyles` hook to use "adjust state during render" pattern instead of synchronous setState in effects

**Files modified:**
- src/components/slideshow.tsx
- src/components/preview.tsx

**Notes for next dev:**
- Theming infrastructure is already in place (useDocumentTheme, theme-renderer, CSS injection)
- The slideshow theming stories should be next priority
- Pre-existing test failures in documents.test.ts and spaces.test.ts (Jazz sync issues) are unrelated

## 2026-01-10: Slideshow Semantic HTML

**Feature:** slideshow-semantic-html (3 user stories)

**Changes:**
- Wrapped slideshow content in `<article>` element with `data-theme` attribute
- Changed headings from `<div>` to proper `<h1>`-`<h6>` elements based on depth
- Changed paragraph text from `<div>` to `<p>` elements

**Files modified:**
- src/components/slideshow.tsx

**Notes for next dev:**
- This enables CSS selectors like `[data-theme="ThemeName"] h1` to work
- The slideshow theming stories should now be unblocked
- Pre-existing test failures in documents.test.ts and spaces.test.ts (Jazz sync issues) are unrelated
