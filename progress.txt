# Progress Log

## 2026-01-09: Theme Schema Implementation

### What was done
- Implemented `Theme` schema in `src/schema/index.ts` with fields:
  - `version` (literal 1)
  - `name`, `author`, `description` (strings)
  - `type` (ThemeType enum: 'preview' | 'slideshow' | 'both')
  - `css` (co.plainText for large CSS content)
  - `template` (optional co.plainText for HTML templates)
  - `presets` (optional JSON string for slideshow presets)
  - `assets` (optional list of ThemeAsset)
  - `thumbnail` (optional co.image)
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (dates)

- Implemented `ThemeAsset` schema for storing theme assets (fonts, images):
  - `name`, `mimeType` (strings)
  - `data` (co.fileStream for binary data)
  - `createdAt` (date)

- Implemented `ThemePreset` zod schema for slideshow color presets:
  - `name`, `appearance` (light/dark)
  - `colors` object with background, foreground, accent, and optional heading, link, codeBackground
  - Optional `fonts` object with title and body font families

- Added `themes: co.optional(co.list(Theme))` to `UserRoot` schema

- Added migration in `UserAccount.withMigration()` to initialize empty themes list for new and existing users

### PRD requirements completed
- [x] schema: "Theme schema stores uploaded theme data" - passes: true
- [x] schema: "Theme references stored as co.plainText for CSS content" - passes: true

### Notes for next steps
- The schema is now ready for the upload functionality
- Next priority should be implementing the Settings UI for theme upload and management
- The `ThemeType` enum and `ThemePreset` zod schema are exported for use in upload validation

## 2026-01-09: Theme Upload and Settings UI

### What was done
- Created `src/lib/theme-upload.ts` for parsing and validating theme zip files:
  - `parseThemeZip(file)` - parses a zip file and extracts all theme content
  - `validateThemeJson(content)` - validates theme.json manifest against schema
  - `ThemeJsonSchema` - zod schema for theme.json validation
  - Handles: theme.json manifest, CSS files, HTML templates, presets.json, fonts, thumbnails
  - Returns typed `ThemeUploadError` for different error conditions

- Added `ThemesSection` component to `src/routes/settings.tsx`:
  - Upload button with file input for .zip files
  - Loading state during upload
  - Error display with detailed validation errors
  - Empty state when no themes uploaded
  - List of uploaded themes showing name, type, and author
  - Delete button with confirmation dialog

- Updated settings query to include themes with CSS and assets loaded

### Files changed
- `src/lib/theme-upload.ts` (new file)
- `src/routes/settings.tsx` (added ThemesSection, updated imports and query)

### PRD requirements completed
- [x] upload: "Users can upload theme zip files in settings" - passes: true
- [x] upload: "Theme zip validation on upload" - passes: true
- [x] upload: "Theme assets are extracted and stored" - passes: true
- [x] settings: "Themes list displayed in settings" - passes: true
- [x] settings: "Theme can be deleted from settings" - passes: true

### Notes for next steps
- "Theme can be set as default" not implemented yet - requires adding default theme fields to Settings
- Thumbnail display in theme list not implemented yet (stored but not shown)
- Next priority: implement frontmatter parsing to apply themes to documents
- CSS asset URL rewriting (for fonts in CSS) will be needed when applying themes

## 2026-01-09: Frontmatter Theme Parsing

### What was done
- Created `src/lib/document-theme.ts` with utilities for parsing and resolving themes from frontmatter:
  - `getThemeName(content)` - extracts theme name from frontmatter `theme:` field
  - `getPresetName(content)` - extracts preset name from frontmatter `preset:` field
  - `findThemeByName(themes, name)` - case-insensitive theme lookup in user's themes list
  - `getThemePresets(theme)` - parses presets JSON from theme
  - `findPresetByName(theme, name)` - case-insensitive preset lookup within a theme
  - `useDocumentTheme(content)` - React hook that resolves theme and preset from document content

- The `useDocumentTheme` hook:
  - Returns `{ theme, preset, warning }` based on frontmatter
  - Handles case-insensitive theme name matching
  - Shows warning when theme is not found in user's themes list
  - Falls back to first preset when specified preset is not found
  - Skips `light`/`dark` values (handled by appearance system)
  - Loads themes with CSS and assets for rendering

### Files changed
- `src/lib/document-theme.ts` (new file)

### PRD requirements completed
- [x] frontmatter: "Theme can be specified in document frontmatter" - passes: true
- [x] frontmatter: "Preset can be specified for slideshow themes" - passes: true

### Notes for next steps
- The hook is ready to use in Preview and Slideshow components
- Next priority: integrate `useDocumentTheme` into Preview component to inject CSS
- Warning UI for missing themes should be added to preview/slideshow views
- CSS asset URL rewriting still needed for fonts/images referenced in theme CSS

## 2026-01-09: Preview Theme CSS Injection

### What was done
- Created `src/lib/theme-renderer.ts` with utilities for building theme CSS:
  - `buildThemeStyles(theme, preset)` - builds complete CSS including @font-face rules and preset variables
  - Creates blob URLs from theme font assets (co.fileStream)
  - Returns `ThemeStyles` object with css, fontFaceRules, presetVariables, and blobUrls
  - Properly handles cleanup of blob URLs when theme changes

- Integrated theme styles into `src/components/preview.tsx`:
  - Added `useDocumentTheme` hook to resolve theme from frontmatter
  - Added `useThemeStyles` custom hook that manages theme CSS and blob URL lifecycle
  - Injects theme CSS via `<style>` tag in preview
  - Injects @font-face rules for theme fonts with blob URLs
  - Injects preset CSS variables (--preset-background, --preset-foreground, etc.)
  - Shows warning banner when theme is not found in user's themes
  - Added `data-theme` attribute to article for theme-specific CSS targeting

- Theme CSS features:
  - Font assets are served via blob URLs created from Jazz fileStream
  - @font-face rules are generated automatically with correct format (woff2, woff, truetype, opentype)
  - font-display: swap for progressive font loading
  - Preset colors exposed as CSS variables for theme authors to use

### Files changed
- `src/lib/theme-renderer.ts` (new file)
- `src/components/preview.tsx` (added theme integration)

### PRD requirements completed
- [x] preview: "Preview component applies theme CSS" - passes: true
- [x] preview: "Preview loads theme fonts" - passes: true

### Notes for next steps
- "Preview uses custom HTML template when provided" not yet implemented
- Next priority could be: slideshow theme support, or custom HTML templates
- The same pattern (useDocumentTheme + buildThemeStyles) can be used for slideshow

## 2026-01-09: Slideshow Theme Support

### What was done
- Integrated theme styles into `src/components/slideshow.tsx`:
  - Added `useDocumentTheme` hook to resolve theme from frontmatter
  - Added `useThemeStyles` custom hook (same pattern as preview)
  - Injects theme CSS via `<style>` tag before slide container
  - Injects @font-face rules for theme fonts with blob URLs
  - Injects preset CSS variables (--preset-background, --preset-foreground, etc.)
  - Shows warning banner when theme is not found in user's themes
  - Added `data-theme` attribute to container for theme-specific CSS targeting

- Background/foreground color handling:
  - When a preset is available, uses CSS variables for background/foreground colors
  - Falls back to existing light/dark/system appearance handling when no preset
  - Renamed internal variable from `theme` to `appearanceTheme` to avoid confusion with custom theme

- Warning banner:
  - Shows absolute-positioned centered banner at top of slideshow
  - Same warning messages as preview (missing theme, missing preset fallback)

### Files changed
- `src/components/slideshow.tsx` (added theme integration)

### PRD requirements completed
- [x] slideshow: "Slideshow component applies theme CSS" - passes: true
- [x] slideshow: "Slideshow applies preset colors" - passes: true
- [x] slideshow: "Slideshow loads theme fonts" - passes: true

### Notes for next steps
- "Slideshow preset respects appearance mode" not yet implemented - requires connecting preset appearance to system theme
- CSS variables feature ("Theme CSS can use predefined CSS variables") is partially done - preset colors work but need documentation
- Next priorities could be: appearance mode handling, security sanitization, or default theme settings

## 2026-01-09: Default Theme Settings

### What was done
- Updated `Settings` schema in `src/schema/index.ts` to include:
  - `defaultPreviewTheme: z.string().optional()` - name of default preview theme
  - `defaultSlideshowTheme: z.string().optional()` - name of default slideshow theme

- Updated `useDocumentTheme` hook in `src/lib/document-theme.ts`:
  - Added `mode` parameter: `'preview' | 'slideshow'` (defaults to 'preview')
  - Falls back to default theme from settings when no theme specified in frontmatter
  - Silently falls back if default theme was deleted (no warning shown)
  - Only shows warning for missing themes explicitly specified in frontmatter
  - Updated `themesQuery` to also load settings for default theme lookup

- Added `DefaultThemeSettings` component in `src/routes/settings.tsx`:
  - Shows dropdown selectors for default preview and slideshow themes
  - Filters themes by type (preview, slideshow, or both)
  - "None" option clears the default
  - Only appears when there are themes of the appropriate type

- Updated Preview component to pass `mode: "preview"` to useDocumentTheme
- Updated Slideshow component to pass `mode: "slideshow"` to useDocumentTheme

### Files changed
- `src/schema/index.ts` (added defaultPreviewTheme, defaultSlideshowTheme to Settings)
- `src/lib/document-theme.ts` (added mode parameter and default theme fallback)
- `src/routes/settings.tsx` (added DefaultThemeSettings component)
- `src/components/preview.tsx` (pass mode to useDocumentTheme)
- `src/components/slideshow.tsx` (pass mode to useDocumentTheme)

### PRD requirements completed
- [x] settings: "Theme can be set as default" - passes: true

### Notes for next steps
- Default themes work via theme name lookup (not by ID), so renaming a theme will break the default
- Remaining priority features: custom HTML templates, appearance mode handling, security, performance, UX picker

## 2026-01-09: Custom HTML Template Support for Preview

### What was done
- Added custom HTML template rendering support to the preview component
- Templates use the `data-document` attribute as a placeholder for injected content

- Updated `ThemesQuery` type in `src/lib/document-theme.ts` to include `template: true`
- Updated `themesQuery` object to load template content alongside CSS and assets

- Added `renderTemplateWithContent(template, content)` function in `src/lib/theme-renderer.ts`:
  - Parses template HTML using DOMParser
  - Finds element with `[data-document]` attribute as injection point
  - Injects rendered markdown HTML into the placeholder
  - Returns the body's innerHTML for rendering in React

- Updated `PreviewContent` in `src/components/preview.tsx`:
  - Gets template string from theme via `documentTheme.theme?.template?.toString()`
  - Combines all segment HTML when template is present
  - Uses `renderTemplateWithContent` to inject content into template
  - Renders templated content with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` when template exists
  - Falls back to default segment-by-segment rendering when no template

### Files changed
- `src/lib/document-theme.ts` (added template to ThemesQuery and themesQuery)
- `src/lib/theme-renderer.ts` (added renderTemplateWithContent function)
- `src/components/preview.tsx` (added template rendering path)

### PRD requirements completed
- [x] preview: "Preview uses custom HTML template when provided" - passes: true

### Notes for next steps
- Security sanitization not yet implemented - templates accept arbitrary HTML (PRD security requirements still pending)
- Template-mode doesn't render inline Jazz images (only text segments combined)
- Next priorities: appearance mode handling for slideshow, CSS variables documentation, security sanitization
