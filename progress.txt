## 2026-01-08: Basic sorting implementation

Implemented `sortTaskLists()` in `src/lib/sort-tasks.ts`.

**What was done:**
- Created `sortTaskLists(markdown: string): string` function
- Sorts unchecked tasks before checked tasks (stable sort)
- Handles: multiple lists, nested children, code fences, all bullet syntaxes (-, *, +), ordered lists
- Preserves relative order within groups
- Full test coverage in `src/lib/sort-tasks.test.ts`

**PRD item completed:** "Basic sorting - unchecked tasks before checked tasks"

**Notes for next person:**
- Ordered list renumbering NOT implemented (PRD item 13 expects `1. [ ]` then `2. [x]` but current impl preserves original numbers)
- The implementation is comprehensive - most other PRD items likely pass but weren't marked as complete per single-feature-per-run rule
- Run `bun test src/lib/sort-tasks.test.ts` to verify
