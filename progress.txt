## 2026-01-10: Slideshow Semantic HTML

**Feature:** slideshow-semantic-html (3 user stories)

**Changes:**
- Wrapped slideshow content in `<article>` element with `data-theme` attribute
- Changed headings from `<div>` to proper `<h1>`-`<h6>` elements based on depth
- Changed paragraph text from `<div>` to `<p>` elements

**Files modified:**
- src/components/slideshow.tsx

**Notes for next dev:**
- This enables CSS selectors like `[data-theme="ThemeName"] h1` to work
- The slideshow theming stories should now be unblocked
- Pre-existing test failures in documents.test.ts and spaces.test.ts (Jazz sync issues) are unrelated
