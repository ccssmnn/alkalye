# Welcome to Alkalye

A beautiful markdown editor. Private by design.

**Currently in free public beta. Self-host anytime.**

---

## Built for the web

Alkalye is a beautiful web app, made to work and look great on any device and OS. **It even works offline.**. Install it on your phone, tablet, or desktop. Your documents sync automatically across all your devices. 

## Your words, encrypted

Everything you write is **end-to-end encrypted**. Not even we can read your documents. Your thoughts stay yours.

## Write together, in real-time

Share a document link and collaborate instantly. Just like you would expect.

## Connect your thoughts

Link documents together with `[[wikilinks]]`. Type `[[` to search and link. Backlinks update automatically—see what's referencing each note.

## Present your ideas

Turn any document into a presentation with `mode: present` in the frontmatter. Use `---` to create slides. Present directly from your notes. Use your phone as a teleprompter.

## No Lock-in

Settings like title, tags, and presentation mode are stored directly in your markdown via frontmatter. Export anytime as a standard `.md` file—no lock-in, no proprietary formats.

## Open Source

Alkalye is MIT licensed and on [GitHub](https://github.com/ccssmnn/alkalye). Take the code, host it yourself, make it yours.

## Pricing

I can provide Alkalye for free while the underlying sync service [Jazz](https://jazz.tools) is in free public alpha.
